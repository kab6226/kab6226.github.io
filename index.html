      "
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I am a freshhman at the University of Texas at Austin
        interested in majoring in International Business at the McCombs School 
        of Business. I grew up in Plano, Texas with my parents, my older sister, and
        six cats and two dogs. I currently work at Chick-Fil-A. I love working out,
        watching The Vampire Diaries, and going to the movie theater! I can usually be found at Chick-Fil-A eating (I know...ironic that I work there, yet I can 
        constantly be found eating there on my days off). I adore animals, anything that is fluffy, and I am a die hard Harry Potter fan!"
